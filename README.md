# HOTEL-BOOKING-PLATFORM
Hotels plays an important role for any person or traveller who are travelling from one
destination to another. Hotel play an important role for tourists whether the tourist is local or
international. Hotel provides many best services to the customer such as parking area, food,
room service and also it provides services that is offered by customer. By providing these
services Hotels take the valuable feedback from the customers. By these feedbacks Hotels
maintains their reputation in the city/area. If the services are poor, the bookings of that hotel are
low and if the services are awesome then high bookings in that hotel takes place.
In this model, the prediction possibility of a booking for a hotel based on different factors and
also try to predict if they need special requests based on different features. In this project the
dataset which we are using contains both International and Local Hotel data. Here we use many
popular Machine Learning Algorithms like Decision Tree, Random Forest, KNN, Logistic
Regression, etc. to predict the cancellation chances. This Model gives the prediction of Hotel
Booking Cancellation up to the certain level of accuracy i.e. 95% (Approx.).
